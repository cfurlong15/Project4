## Next Steps

Moving forward, TaskTrackr will implement several key enhancements.

- Tasks and projects will be listed in ascending order by due date, unless they are marked as complete -- as incomplete tasks and projects will be prioritized. 
- The app will apply conditional styling. For example, tasks marked as complete will be accompanied by a green background, to let users know they can move on to the next. 
- Users will be able to share a project with other users so they can collaborate.
- Google Calendar will be integrated so users can add any task due date to their own personal calendars.
